# Account_Manager
Simple implementation of an account management system.

An Object Oriented Design class project that I have been making amendments to in order to better understand the MVC model, Java Swing, JUnit testing and how they are implemented.

Creating an account:
The Account Manager will allow the user to create an account for a new client, assigning only an ID that is not already in existence.

Editing an account:
Allows the user to update the balance of the account by conducting a deposit or withdrawal transaction.

Remove Account:
Allows the user to remove an existing account.
